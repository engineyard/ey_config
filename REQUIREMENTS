a script/ci should ensure that this gem works in both 1.9 and 1.8.7

Should probably attempt to test with jruby and rubinius too

If the gem is called engineyard-configuration, then the class should match: EngineYard::Configuration or Engineyard::Configuration

Would like to see EngineYard::Configuration[:some_service][:some_var] as the API

hashes should be indifferent of access:
  EngineYard::Configuration[:some_service]['some_var'] should be the same as EngineYard::Configuration["some_service"][:some_var]

Needs to be tested with all supported engineyard web servers.  Will current directory always be correct? (will CONFIG_PATH_DEFAULT = '../shared/config/deploy.yml' always work?)

Needs to work from cron which may invoke rails from a different path:
example:
  1.9.2 [ey@seckel p] $ cd /
  1.9.2 [ey@seckel /] $ /Users/ey/p/tresfiestas/script/rails runner "puts File.expand_path('../test')"
  /test

  vs.

  1.9.2 [ey@seckel /] $ cd /Users/ey/p/tresfiestas
  1.9.2 [ey@seckel tresfiestas] [master]$ script/rails runner "puts File.expand_path('../test')"
  /Users/ey/p/test

If you use the YAML constant, you need to require 'yaml'

Example Use case:
  I have a rails app with a file: config/initializers/airbrake.rb
  it's contents are:

    require 'airbrake'
    Airbrake.configure do |config| 
      config.api_key = EngineYard::Configuration["Airbrake"][:api_key]
      config.secure  = false
      config.logger = Rails.logger
    end

  When my rails app loads this initializer it should read the api_key from ../shared/config/deploy.yml which looks like:

    ---
    Airbrake:
      api_key: 1233a8abc03e456d2298b988fe2627ab
